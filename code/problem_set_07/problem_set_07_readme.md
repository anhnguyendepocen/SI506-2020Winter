# SI 506: Problem Set 07
This week, we will be working with the *coolest* part of Python: Classes! You will need
to utilize two different input files, "sh_basic_info.csv" and "sh_additional_info.csv", to
gather information on three super-powered women from the Marvel universe. You will build
a class with which to organize this information, and then use that class to do specific
data manipulation for each heroine. The skeleton code file, problem_set_07.py, contains
areas that need your work, which are demarcated by "TO DO:".

Retrieve the problem set 07 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_07)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_07.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
