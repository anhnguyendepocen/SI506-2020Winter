# SI 506: Problem Set 07
This week, you will be working for the galactic First Order in order to locate key members of the Resistance. You will use your knowledge of json, APIs, classes, methods, and functions in order to construct a main() function that will cross-reference two different data files. You will need to make use of an additional file, <informants.json>, to complete this assignment. The skeleton code file, problem_set_09.py, contains areas that need your work, which are demarcated by "TO DO:".

Retrieve the problem set 09 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_09)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_09.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
