# SI 506: Problem Set 08
This week, we will be working with the *advanced* part of Classes: Inheritance! You'll work and code as a Software Engineer of a game company. You are asked to construct objects for those heroes in the game and also simulate the game. The skeleton code file, problem_set_08.py, contains
areas that need your work, which are demarcated by "TO DO:".

Retrieve the problem set 08 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_08)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_08.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
