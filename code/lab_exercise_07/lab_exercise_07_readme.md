# SI 506: Lab Exercise 07

This week's lab exercise will focus on working with files and prepare you for this week's
problem set. You will find that several of the generic functions that you will construct in
this lab are very similar to what you will be asked to do on the homework (some of the functions
you will be able to directly copy and paste!). Thus is the power of functions!

Retrieve the lab exercise 07 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/lab_exercise_07)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`lab_exercise_07.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recorded and displayed.  You may re-submit your exercise as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
