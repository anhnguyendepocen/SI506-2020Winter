# SI 506: Problem Set 06
This week's problem set will have you build a function-first python script. You will build out
four utility functions (an additional one will be provided), and then call them all in the
correct order in a main() function in order to solve a task. Note that the functions you build
in this assignment may be useful in future assignments, particularly the read_csv() and write_csv()
functions.

Retrieve the problem set 06 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_06)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_06.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
