# Readings: Week 14

This week you will learn how to create lists and dictionaries using
*comprehensions*, compact expressions that can be expressed in a single
line of code.

I've also included a reading on how to document your code. You have been reading
Docstrings and other code comments throughout the semester in lecture and
assignment code. As part of the upcoming final assignment you will get a chance
to write your own Docstrings.

Finally, as you begin to move beyond the novice-level towards writing more
complex code, you should familiarize yourself with the style conventions
described in the Python Community's
[Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
(PEP 8) and adopt the recommendations. Doing so will align the code you write
with the rest of the community, enhancing both its readability and
maintainability. Abiding by PEP 8 styling guidelines will also make it easier
for you to collaborate with other Python programmers in future.

You will continue working with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and JSON files, foreshadowing upcoming work on the final assignment.

## List comprehensions

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["Understanding List Comprehensions in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-list-comprehensions-in-python-3) (DigitalOcean, Jan 2017).**

Very short introduction to the topic. Once you have read Lisa proceed *directly*
to Trey Hunner's blog post.

**Trey Hunner, ["Python List Comprehensions: Explained Visually"](https://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/) (Trey Hunner, 15 Dec 2015).**

What I and others like about Trey's blog post is the way he helps the reader
familiar with writing `for` loops transition to writing comprehensions. A must
read.

**Josh Robin, ["Dictionary Comprehension in Python 3 for Beginners"](https://medium.com/@joshuapaulrobin/dictionary-comprehension-in-python3-for-beginners-54fb4ddd3982) (Medium, May 2019).**

Josh fills in the details covering how to write comprehensions that iterate
over dictionary keys and values in tandem.

## Docstrings

**James Mertz, ["Documenting Python Code: A Complete Guide"](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) (RealPython, nd).**

James distinguishes between commenting and documenting your code. See in
particular the section on "Script Docstrings" providing script and function
documentation examples.

## Python Style Guide (PEP 8)

**Jasmine Finer, ["How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8"](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) (RealPython, Dec 2018).**

Writing Python code to be read as well as run is a key aspect of Python programming. Jasmine ably summarizes the Python Community's [Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (PEP 8).
