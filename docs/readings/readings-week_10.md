# Readings: Week 10

This week you will learn how to create, read, and modify files on the file system. Data previously accessed via an in-file list will instead be stored in files that you will access programmatically. You will work with plain text files and comma delimited value files known by the acronym CSV. We will also discuss the `FileNotFoundError`, raised whenever a file or directory is requested but doesn’t exist.

You will utilize the [Python Standard Library's](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) `csv` module when working with CSV files. Referencing the `csv` module in your code so you can use it will introduce you to the `import` statement.

You will also continue working with strings, lists, and dictionaries, functions, conditional statements, and list and string slicing.

## Files

**Charles Severance, [Python for Everybody. Exploring data in Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book) (CreateSpace, 2016).**

:bulb: Entry point for the beginner.

Read Chapter 7 “Files”.

Read Chuck on basic file operations (creating, opening, reading from, writing to, appending) as well as try/except blocks. Then review Eric's chapter and Michelle's article.

**Eric Matthes, [Python Crash Course](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781492071266/), 2nd Edition (No Starch Press, 2019).**

Read Chapter 10 ["Files and Exceptions"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781492071266/xhtml/ch10.xhtml#ch10), sections:

* "Reading from a File"
* "Writing to a File"

Eric's first two sections of his chapter on files and exceptions complement Chuck's chapter.

## Working with Plain Text Files

**Michelle Morales, ["How to Handle Plain Text Files in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-handle-plain-text-files-in-python-3) (Digital Ocean, Oct. 2016).**

A useful primer (and a quick read).

## Importing Modules

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["How To Import Modules in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-import-modules-in-python-3) (Digital Ocean, Sept 2016).**

Lisa's article will introduce you to Python's modular and extensible architecture and how to use the `import` statement in your code in order to access Python modules and their functions,classes, and variables. Module imports is all about code reuse. This week you will import the `csv` module in order to simplify working with CSV files. Later you will import and use other modules such as `datetime`, `json`, `os`, and `requests`.

## Working with CSV Files

**Jon Fincher, ["Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python"](https://realpython.com/python-csv/) (Real Python, nd).**

Read the first two sections:

* What is a CSV file?
* Parsing CSV Files With Python’s Built-in CSV Library

Jon discusses how to read from and write to comma-separated values files (CSV) using the Python Standard Library's `csv` module.

## File Object Methods Reference

**w3schools, ["Python File methods"](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_file.asp) (w3schools.com, nd).**

Not quite a cheat sheet but close. Use it as a reference.
